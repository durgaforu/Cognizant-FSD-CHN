Abstact class
--------------
-> An Abstract is class which provide  method specification.
-> Abstract class contains zero or more abstract methods
   and concreate methods
-> We cannnot create an object to Abstract class.
-> We can create a reference to an abstract class
-> The reference of  an abstract class can store all its
   implementation/sub class objects
-> The refrence of an abstract class can be used to acess 
   all the methods of an abstract class and overrideen    methods of sub classes
-> The refence of an abstract class cannot be used to access
   the invidivial methods( methods which are tere in sub    class and not there in super class) of an sub class
-> An abstract method is a method specifecation. It does not
   provide body/impplementation
-> Abstract class can not be defined as 'final'
-> All the sub classes of an abstract must over ride 'all' 
   abstract methods of an abstract class.
-> If any sub class of abstarct class  is not overriding         any abstract method, then that sub class must be defined
   as 'abstract'

Note:
-----
-> Abtsratc class does not provide 100% abstraction
-> No extensionbility with abstract classes
