class
-------
-> Two Types of Classes
	-> Simple class
	-> Complex Class

Simple class
-------------
A class who can hold only one type of content
Ex: String s1="Abc";
    Integer i=100;

Complex class
--------------
A class who can hold more than one type of data
Ex: Employee, Bank, Student etc


Constructor
--------------
->It is a member of a class which gets executed when the   object of the class is created.
-> Constructor name and class name should be same
-> Constructor must not have return type. Not even void
-> Constructor can have parameters.

Why we use constructors?
-------------------------
-> To initialise data to the class obj before any method gets
   called
-> To mandate class properies must be initialised while 
   creating the object.

Note:
-----
-> JVM adds a default constructor when you are not providing
   any parametarised constructor.
-> JVM will not be adding any default constructor if you are    proving parametarized constructor
-> We can Initialze data to a final variable in constructor


POJO/Bean/Entity Class
------------------------
POJO stands for Plain old java object

Rules for creating/constructing POJO classes
----------------------------------------------
-> Every property in  class should be 	
-> Every method in class should be defined as 'public' with
   getXXX and setXXX
