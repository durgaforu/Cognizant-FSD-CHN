Notes
------
-> we can compile any class in java 
-> we cannot run a class in java with out main method

-> static methods accepts only static data. 
-> static methods never allow instance/ non static methods or
   variables directly.

-> we can access non static data from a static methods only 
   with the help of a 'object'

-> static data is sharable to all the objects of a class
-> instance data is available only to a particular object
-> Non static methods allows tgo access static and non static    data directly with out help of a object in the same class
