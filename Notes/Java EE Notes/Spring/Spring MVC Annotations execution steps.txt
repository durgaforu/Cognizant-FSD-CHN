Steps
-----------
-> Any request ends with .htm goes to a class    ServletInitializer
-> Spring verifies a method getServletMappings, and verifies     with given requet url.
-> If given request url is matching then       getServletConfigClasses methos gets executed on same class.
-> What ever the classes returning in getServletConfigClasses 
   method that class gets executed. (WebConfig)
-> We have configured WebConfig.class to the       getServletConfigClasses method as return type
-> Spring container executes class WebConfig class
-> Spring container verifies package component scan and       executes the requested mapping if any controller class
   is mapped with it. 
                        ------ * ------

Configuring the project
------------------------
1. Provide ServletInitializer class to configure       DispatcherServlet controller and url mappings
2. Provide WebConfig class to configure Spring MVC web 
   related configurations like Viewresolvers etc
3. Provide AppConfig class to configure non web congiguration
   classes like service, dao and entitity classes etc
