Java Program
	-> Tight coupling
	-> Loose coupling

Tight Coupling
---------------
	-> No extendability
	-> All class components tighly coupled wach other
	-> Code maintanence issues

Loose Coupling
---------------
	-> Extendability
	-> All clas components are independently constructed
	-> code organization and maintanence is easy
