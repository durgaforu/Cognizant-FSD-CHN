-> Web container validates web.xml file while starting the       server
-> web server validates each applications web.xml file while
   starting the server
-> if any applications web.xml is not valid, then that    application context object is not created.

--> WC opens web.xml for each request to the server from teh    client, and verifies url-mapping value.
--> If client request is matching with corresponding url-     mapping value, then WC picks up its server name, and     jumps into servlet setion, and  any servlet name found     with url-mapping servr name in servlet section, then, 
    that servlet name's class gets executed

-------------------------------------------------------
--> WC creates servlet class object only once if it is not 
    already created.
--> Only one servlet object is created for multiple clients 
    requests.
--> init method gets called only one time for all the     requests
--> service method gets called each time for all the clients 
    requestes
--> destroy method gets called only once, when context object is destroyed.
